Dir2Dac

Take a directory full of sql scripts, add in some references and db options and create a dacpac from it.

Still a work in progress but basically works.

To add a reference to a dacpac there is no way to do it using the api so the way I do it is:

	- Create a new TSqlModel with nothing in it
	- Save that to a .dacpac
	- Manually edit the dacpac to include the references (using the packaging api)
	- Re-open the model and add in all the script objects

This is a bit of a faff about but *seems* to work...
